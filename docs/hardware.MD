I would recommend an SSD before beginning with anything else. SSDs are incredibly cheap and faster than HDDs. 

the only advice i can give for building a PC is not to cheap out on the PSU (power supply unit) better to have a good one 

make sure your fans are running at their best. clean out your PC with air spray every month or two. 

integrated GPUs are fine as long as you have a good CPU. however dedicated GPUs will always be better

if you have a dedicated GPU, make sure to connect your video cord (DisplayPort or HDMI) to the GPU directly

always try to achive dual channel RAM. use either two or four sticks of RAM to achive it

unplug any unused USB devices. same goes for PCIe devices

use Ethernet if possible. if not try to go for a clear way to a router. as little walls and obstructions as possible

if thats not an option use any type of range extender. if you want a good experience dont cheap out on those

try to go for a Wifi card that has the same "generation" as your router. if one is Wifi 6E, make sure the Wifi card is too

if you must use an external card (like through a USB port) make sure it is facing the router's general direction

ensure you have a drive that is not corrupted. you can use various drive testing programs
