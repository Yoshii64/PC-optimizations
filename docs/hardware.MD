i would recommend an SSD before beginning with anything else. SSDs are incredibly cheap and faster than HDDs. 

the only advice i can give for building a PC is not to cheap out on the PSU (power supply unit) better to have a good one 

make sure your fans are running at their best. clean out your PC with air spray every month or two. 

integrated GPUs are fine as long as you have a good CPU. however dedicated GPUs will always be better

if you have a dedicated GPU, make sure to connect your video cord (DisplayPort or HDMI) to the GPU directly

always try to achive dual channel RAM. use either two or four sticks of RAM to achive it
