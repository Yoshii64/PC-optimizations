if you're planning to use Edge here's the settings I recommend
### Privacy, search, and services
* Always use “Strict” tracking prevention when browsing InPrivate - on
* Allow sites to check if you have payment methods saved - off
* Send "Do Not Track" requests - on
* Allow Microsoft to save your browsing activity including history, usage, favorites, web content, and other browsing data to personalize Microsoft Edge and Microsoft services like ads, search, shopping and news - off (depends on privacy settings)
* Microsoft Defender SmartScreen - optional. I personally turn it off
* Save time and money with Shopping in Microsoft Edge - off
* Include related matches in Find on page - off
* Let Microsoft Edge help keep your tabs organized - off
### appearence

in "Select which buttons to show on the toolbar:" turn everything except downloads off
### Sidebar
