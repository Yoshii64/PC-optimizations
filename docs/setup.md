now to getting the ISO. we will look at Windows 10 and 11 for this.

for Windows 10 we can use the [Media Creation Tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209). made by Microsoft themselves.

go through it until the "what do you want to do" screen. [choose Installation media](https://github.com/Yoshii64/PC-tuning-/blob/main/images/MediaTool1.png)
then use the recommended settings on the next screen

you can choose either USB or ISO. if you choose ISO though make sure you use Rufus or Ventoy to put it on a USB drive.

after downloading the ISO and putting it onto the USB, make sure your BIOS boot order has the USB drive first. or use a temporary boot menu
usually can get into a temporary boot menu by mashing F12.

now you should be in Windows installation.

for region choose "English (World)" this will cut out some of the bloatware in Windows. go through everything as normal until OOBE

now to Windows 11. go to [here](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) and go to "Select the product language"
if that dosent appear go to "Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices" and choose the only option. should direct you.

choose your language and it should bring you to "Download - Windows 11 [language]" and click "64-bit Download" and it should download.
